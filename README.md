5. **Other notes**
    - ⚠️ If you encounter issues with `pymssql`, adjust its version in `requirements.txt` or remove it before building the Docker image.
    - ⚠️ If you encounter issues with `pyspark`, you might need to uninstall and reinstall it. Additionally, ensure that Java is installed and properly configured on your system, as `pyspark` depends on Java. You can install Java by following the instructions on the [official Java website](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html). Make sure to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your Java installation directory.
