## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

You can run the application in two ways:

- **Locally using `uv`**
- **Using Docker Compose**

### üîß Option 1 ‚Äî Run Locally with `uv`

> `uv` is a fast and modern Python tool that handles virtual environments and dependencies via `pyproject.toml`.

1. **Install `uv`** (if not already installed)  
   ```bash
   curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LudovicGardy/app_name
   cd app_folder/
   ```

3. **Create and activate the environment**  
   ```bash
   uv venv
   ```

   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - On **Windows** (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

4. **(Optional) If the virtual environment doesn't behave properly**

   Sometimes, on macOS in particular, the environment might be missing some tooling (like `pip`). You can try the following fixes:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python -m ensurepip --upgrade
   .venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   # Optional: Only if you need to use Jupyter notebooks
   .venv/bin/python -m pip install ipykernel -U --force-reinstall
   ```

5. **Launch the app**  
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

### üê≥ Option 2 ‚Äî Run with Docker Compose

1. **Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running**

2. **Go to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/app_folder
   ```

3. **Build and start the app**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the app**
   Open your browser at: [http://localhost:8502](http://localhost:8502)
